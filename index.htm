<h1><center>New Vishwanath Temple</center></h1>
<h3><center>Located inside Banaras Hindu University, this temple has tourists flocking to its doors on a daily basis. The Birla family that has been a hugely successful group of entrepreneurs in India commissioned its construction, leading locals to call it Birla Temple. A great thing about the temple is that it isn’t just one building, but actually seven separate temples that together make one big religious complex. The legendary old Vishwanath temple is a direct inspiration for the design of this temple. Every wall of it is covered in the utterings of Lord Krishna, when he recited the Bhagwad Gita.

<h1><center>Ramnagar Fort</center></h1>
<h3><center>Located across the Ganga River from Tulsi Ghat, it was built out of sandstone in AD 1750 on the orders of Raja Balwant Singh, the king of Banaras at the time. He and his descendants have lived in that fort for centuries now. In 1971, the position of an official king was abolished by the government, but still Pelu Bhiru Singh, is commonly referred to as the Maharaja of Varanasi. Even though it was built by Hindu kings, it is a testament to the diversity of the region that it was built in the Mughal architectural style. It houses Veda Vyasa Temple, the king’s living quarters, and a museum dedicated to regional history.</center></h3>
